Visible light, as shown in Figure 6.2, is a small portion of the electromagnetic spectrum and includes light with wavelengths between 400 and 700 nanometers. When light hits an object, the wavelengths that are reflected by the object determine its color:

If an object reflects all wavelengths of visible light equally, it appears white.
If an object reflects only certain wavelengths, it appears colored. For instance, an object that reflects light primarily in the wavelength range between 500 and 570 nm appears green, as this is the range for green light. The rest of the light (other wavelengths) is absorbed by the object.
