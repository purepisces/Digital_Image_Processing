Visible light, as shown in Figure 6.2, is a small portion of the electromagnetic spectrum and includes light with wavelengths between 400 and 700 nanometers. When light hits an object, the wavelengths that are reflected by the object determine its color:

If an object reflects all wavelengths of visible light equally, it appears white.
If an object reflects only certain wavelengths, it appears colored. For instance, an object that reflects light primarily in the wavelength range between 500 and 570 nm appears green, as this is the range for green light. The rest of the light (other wavelengths) is absorbed by the object.




Achromatic Light: This refers to light that doesn't have any color, such as shades of gray (ranging from black to white). The only characteristic of achromatic light is its intensity, which measures how bright or dark the light is.
Chromatic Light: This is light that has color, and it spans the range of visible light. The qualities of chromatic light are measured in terms of:
Radiance: The total amount of energy emitted by a light source (measured in watts).
Luminance: The amount of energy from the light source that can be perceived by an observer (measured in lumens).
Brightness: This is a subjective measure, based on how bright the light appears to an observer. It is influenced by the intensity of the light and is difficult to measure objectively.
In summary, color is a physical phenomenon caused by the interaction of light with objects, which reflect certain wavelengths and absorb others. Our perception of color depends on the wavelengths of light that an object reflects, while the physical nature of light can be described in terms of its intensity, energy, and the wavelengths that make up visible light.

This statement explains that the term "primary colors" is often misunderstood. Many people think that mixing red, green, and blue light in various proportions can produce all visible colors, but this is not entirely true. While red, green, and blue (RGB) are the primary colors in the additive color model, there are limitations to this system.

The key misunderstanding is that you cannot generate all possible colors in the visible spectrum by just mixing these three colors at fixed wavelengths. To truly generate all visible colors, you would also need to adjust the wavelength of the light itself, which goes beyond the capabilities of the basic RGB system.

What It Means:
Primary Colors of Light: Red, green, and blue are called primary colors of light because, when mixed in different intensities, they can produce a wide range of colors. This is the foundation of how displays (like TVs and monitors) work.

Misinterpretation: Many people think that simply by adjusting the intensity of red, green, and blue light, you can produce any color, but that’s not the case. There are some colors that cannot be created just by mixing these three lights at their fixed wavelengths.

Limitation of Fixed Wavelengths: Each primary color (red, green, blue) in an RGB system has a fixed wavelength (e.g., red is around 700 nm, green is around 546 nm, blue is around 435 nm). You can adjust the intensity of these colors, but you cannot change their wavelengths.

Wavelengths Influence Color: To truly produce every color that the human eye can see, you would need to go beyond just adjusting the intensity of fixed RGB lights—you’d need to also change the wavelengths of the light itself. This would involve shifting the primary colors to different points on the electromagnetic spectrum, meaning you would no longer have three fixed primary colors.

Example:
Let’s say you want to reproduce the color turquoise:

In an RGB system, you would try to mix green and blue light in different intensities to simulate turquoise. While you can get a close approximation of turquoise, the result might not be exact, because the wavelengths of the green and blue light you’re mixing are fixed and may not precisely match the wavelengths required to produce pure turquoise.
To truly create every possible shade in the visible spectrum (including very pure colors), you would need to adjust the wavelength of the light, not just the intensity. This is beyond what the standard RGB color mixing system can do, as it only allows you to work with fixed red, green, and blue wavelengths.

Practical Example:
Think of a computer monitor or TV that uses red, green, and blue pixels:

The screen can mix these three primary colors in different intensities to create a wide range of colors, but not every possible color that the human eye can perceive.
If you try to produce certain very specific colors—like some shades of violet or deep cyan—the screen may not be able to replicate them perfectly because it is limited by the fixed wavelengths of the RGB lights.
In contrast, laser systems or more advanced display technologies that use more than three primary colors or that can vary the wavelengths of the light can produce a much wider range of colors. These systems go beyond the RGB model by adjusting the wavelengths of light, rather than relying solely on intensity.

Conclusion:
The term "primary colors" is often misinterpreted to mean that red, green, and blue light can produce every color. This is not true unless you also allow the wavelength of the light to vary, which would require more than just three fixed primary colors. The RGB system is powerful but limited—it can produce many colors but not the entire spectrum that the human eye can perceive.
