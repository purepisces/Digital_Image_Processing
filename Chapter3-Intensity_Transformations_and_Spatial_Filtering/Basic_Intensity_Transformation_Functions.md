This section of the chapter discusses some basic **intensity transformation functions**, which are essential in image processing. These transformations allow you to adjust pixel intensities to achieve various effects, such as enhancing contrast, inverting the image, or compressing intensity ranges. Let me walk you through the different transformations and provide concrete examples to explain how they work.

### 1. **Raw Pixel Intensity Values**:

-   In some images (e.g., Fourier spectrum images, medical images, or images generated from scientific data), pixel intensities can range over a large scale, such as **0 to 1,500,000** or even higher. These raw intensities represent the data values directly, which can vary significantly based on the data source or type of image.
-   For example, the Fourier spectrum often produces very large intensity values, reflecting the magnitude of frequency components in the image. These values are essential for analysis but aren't directly suitable for display because of their wide dynamic range.

### 2. **Display Intensity Range** (e.g., 8-bit display):

-   Most displays, such as an **8-bit monitor**, can only show intensity levels ranging from **0 to 255**. This is because an 8-bit display can represent 256 distinct intensity levels, where:
    -   **0** represents black (no brightness).
    -   **255** represents white (maximum brightness).These displays cannot directly show images with intensity values ranging from 0 to 1,500,000 because the range is too wide. As a result, if the raw data is scaled linearly to fit the 8-bit range, the high values dominate, and most lower values appear too dark to notice.

### 1. Image Negatives (Inverse Transformation)

The **image negative transformation** is commonly used to invert the intensity levels of an image. This technique is particularly useful when enhancing white or gray details in darker regions, such as in medical X-rays or mammograms. The transformation is described by the equation:

$$s = L - 1 - r$$

Where:

-   $r$ is the input pixel intensity,
-   $s$ is the output pixel intensity,
-   $L$ is the number of possible intensity levels (e.g., 256 for an 8-bit image).

#### Example:

Consider a grayscale mammogram image where the pixel intensity levels are in the range [0, 255]. Suppose we have a pixel with intensity $r = 100$. Using the negative transformation, the output pixel intensity will be:

$s = 256 -1 - 100 = 155$

This reverses the brightness of the pixel. Darker areas become lighter, and lighter areas become darker. When applied to the entire image, the result is a "negative" version of the image, where details in the dark regions (such as lesions) become more prominent. This can help medical professionals see subtle details more clearly.

### 2. Log Transformations

**Logarithmic transformations** are used to enhance images with a wide range of intensity values, especially when we need to stretch low intensity values while compressing higher ones. This can help bring out details in dark areas without losing too much detail in bright areas.

The formula for the log transformation is:

$s = c \cdot \log(1 + r)$

Where:

-   $s$ is the transformed pixel intensity.
-   $r$ is the input pixel intensity.
-   $c$ is a constant used to scale the result.
-   $\log(1 + r)$ ensures that the logarithm function works even for pixel intensities of $r = 0$, as the logarithm of zero is undefined.

This transformation maps a narrow range of low-intensity values to a wider range of output levels, enhancing dark regions while compressing brighter ones.

#### Example:

In the Fourier spectrum example, pixel intensities can range from **0 to 1.5 × 10^6**, meaning that some parts of the image have very high intensity values, while others are much darker. If this image is displayed on a typical **8-bit display**, which can show only **256 intensity levels** (from 0 to 255), the brightest pixels will dominate the display. As a result, much of the image will appear black, with only a few bright areas visible. To address this, we can apply a log transformation.

#### Without Log Transformation (Linear Scaling):

-   If we directly scale the intensity values linearly to fit the 8-bit display, most of the lower-intensity pixels will be shown as black. This is because the few very bright pixels (with values near 1.5 × 10^6) will stretch the scaling so that all the lower values are compressed into the darker range.
-   **Figure 3.5(a)** shows this effect: only the brightest areas of the Fourier spectrum are visible, while the rest of the image appears mostly black, hiding important details in the lower-intensity regions.

#### With Log Transformation:

To resolve this, we can apply the **log transformation** $s = c \cdot \log(1 + r)$ with $c = 1$. This transformation compresses the high-intensity values and expands the lower-intensity values.

-   Applying the log transformation to the pixel values changes the range of the image from $[0, 1.5 \times 10^6]$ to a much smaller range, for example, $[0, 6.2]$.
-   After this transformation, we can **scale the resulting values** to fit within the 8-bit display range (0 to 255). This allows the display to show **more details** in both the dark and bright regions of the image.
    -  For example, a pixel with intensity $r = 1,000,000$ would map to: $s = \log(1 + 1,000,000) \approx 13.82$

This compresses the wide range of intensity values into a smaller, more manageable range, making it easier to display the full spectrum of details in the image.

### 3. Power-Law (Gamma) Transformations

**Power-law transformations** are widely used for contrast manipulation and gamma correction in displays. The transformation is described by the formula:

$s = c \cdot r^\gamma$

Where:

-   $s$ is the output pixel intensity.
-   $r$ is the input pixel intensity (normalized to the range [0, 1]).
-   $c$ is a constant (typically set to 1).
-   $\gamma$ is the exponent that controls how the input intensities are transformed.

The value of $\gamma$ controls whether the transformation emphasizes low-intensity or high-intensity values. When $\gamma < 1$, the transformation enhances dark regions. When $\gamma > 1$, the transformation compresses bright pixels, making them darker and reducing the dominance of bright areas. 


> For $\gamma < 1$, it enhances dark regions, as seen in the graph of $x^{0.5} = \sqrt{x}$

### 4. Gamma Correction for Display Devices

Many display devices, such as cathode ray tube (CRT) monitors, have a **gamma response** that darkens images. To correct this and display the image faithfully, we use **gamma correction**.

For instance, if a monitor has a gamma of 2.5, an image that looks too dark can be corrected using the following transformation:

$$s = r^{1/2.5} = r^{0.4}$$

#### Example:

-   **Original Image**: A grayscale image is displayed on a CRT monitor with gamma 2.5, making it appear darker.
-   **Gamma-Corrected Image**: Applying gamma correction with $\gamma = 0.4$ brightens the image, restoring it to its intended appearance.

The corrected image appears brighter and closer to the original, making it easier to view.

----------

### Contrast Enhancement Using Power-Law Transformations

In this case, power-law transformations can also be used to **manipulate contrast** in an image. If an image appears too dark (as in the MRI spine image), power-law transformation can expand the intensity levels in dark regions to reveal more details.

#### Example:

In the MRI example:

-   With $\gamma = 0.6$, the image becomes slightly brighter, revealing some details.
-   As $\gamma$ decreases to 0.4, more contrast is visible, and finer details become clearer.
-   However, decreasing $\gamma$ too much (e.g., to 0.3) starts to reduce contrast in the background, making the image appear washed out.

----------

### Summary

These intensity transformation functions (negative, logarithmic, and power-law) are essential for enhancing images by manipulating pixel intensity values. Whether you're trying to bring out dark details in an X-ray, correct the brightness of a monitor, or compress a wide range of pixel values, these techniques allow you to achieve the desired visual effect.
