The characteristics generally used to distinguish one color from another are brightness, hue, and saturation. As indicated earlier in this section, brightness embodies the achromatic notion of intensity. Hue is an attribute associated with the dominant wavelength in a mixture of light waves. Hue represents dominant color as perceived by an observer. Thus, when we call an object red, orange, or yellow, we are referring to its hue. Saturation refers to the relative purity or the amount of white light mixed with a hue. The pure spectrum colors are fully saturated. Colors such as pink (red and white) and lavender (violet and white) are less saturated, with the degree of saturation being inversely proportional to the amount of white light added.
